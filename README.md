# CIS 50 AI Course Projects

## Overview
Welcome to my repository documenting my exploration into Artificial Intelligence through the [CIS 50 AI course by HarvardX](https://learning.edx.org/course/course-v1:HarvardX+CS50AI+1T2020/home). Transitioning from web development, I aim to leverage AI technologies for future innovations. This repository serves as a platform to share projects, experiments, and insights gained throughout the course.

### Course Link
For detailed information about the course, visit [CIS 50 AI on edX](https://learning.edx.org/course/course-v1:HarvardX+CS50AI+1T2020/home).

### My Notes
I also maintain a [WordPress blog](https://robertshogandev.wordpress.com) where I delve deeper into my learning experiences and reflections. Feel free to explore for more in-depth discussions.

## Projects
Below is a list of projects contained in this repository, each corresponding to a key topic or assignment from the CIS 50 AI course. The projects are organized in individual Jupyter Notebooks for better organization and understanding:

### Maze Solver
An implementation of various search algorithms to navigate through mazes. This project showcases algorithms such as Breadth-First Search (BFS), Depth-First Search (DFS), and A* Search, among others. Key highlights include:

- **BFS Maze Solver**: Utilizes the Breadth-First Search algorithm to find the shortest path through mazes.
- **DFS Maze Solver**: Implements Depth-First Search for maze navigation, demonstrating the differences in pathfinding strategies. (coming soon)
- **A* Maze Solver**: Employs the A* Search algorithm, highlighting its efficiency in finding optimal paths through heuristics. (coming soon)

[Additional projects and descriptions to be added as the course progresses...]

## How to Use This Repository
To get started with the projects:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/yourrepositoryname.git

## Acknowledgments

- A heartfelt thank you to HarvardX for the CIS 50 AI course, which has been instrumental in my AI learning journey.
- Appreciation to the open-source community for the resources and tools that facilitate projects like these.


### Notes for Customization:
- **Blog Link**: Replace the `#` in `[WordPress blog](https://robertshogandev.wordpress.com)` with the actual URL to your blog posts related to this course or AI in general.
- **Repository URL**: Make sure to substitute `[Github](https://github.com/robert-s-hogan/cs50ai/tree/main)` with the actual URL of your GitHub repository.
- **License**: If you choose a license different from MIT, adjust the `License` section accordingly and ensure the corresponding license file is included in your repository.

This comprehensive `README.md` is designed to be a starting point. Feel free to personalize it further to match your project's scope, your personal insights, and the specifics of your learning journey in AI.
